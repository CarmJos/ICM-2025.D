# 2025 ICM Problem D: A Roadmap to a Better City

## Background

Transportation systems can help or harm a city’s growth and the lives of its residents. 

A successful transportation **infrastructure** can attract businesses, schools, tourists, and new residents. 
The transportation challenges that cities face are complex and intertwined. 
The various stakeholders (city residents, business owners, suburban residents, commuters, 
**passthrough** travelers, tourists, etc.) have different needs and priorities within those systems. 
Often one element or component of a transportation system favors one stakeholder over others therefore 
creating an interference with other needs of the system. Highways, bus routes, and rail systems can
interfere with local city bikers and pedestrians and vice versa when vehicle drivers are delayed 
by city walkways and traffic lights. Sometimes, the biggest obstacle to effective transportation 
systems is the city’s geography – water (rivers, harbors, streams, drainage runoff) 
or landforms (hills, ditches, valleys, slopes). Even soil composition and weather conditions can be disruptive.

## Situation

Baltimore, Maryland, USA is a city affected by aging infrastructure and limited transportation options 
that impact people’s lives and hinder its economic growth. 
Adding to that is the recent collapse of a major bridge (Francis Scott Key Bridge) closing a major highway 
across its busy harbor. Baltimore has been making plans to improve its transportation network through 
infrastructure improvement and enhancing its public transportation as a part of its sustainability goals. 
These goals are based upon identifying, prioritizing, and implementing initiatives such as collaboration 
between stakeholders, maintaining or updating its physical systems, using data more effectively, 
and seeking technological advancements that enhance the lives of its residents and visitors.

Baltimore has a bustling port and shipping center along with being located on a major interstate highway (I-95).
Several of its passthrough and commuter highways and rail lines block or interfere with streets and neighborhoods 
making it difficult for city residents to access job opportunities in the shipping industries and for local businesses 
to transport goods into and around neighborhoods. Through planning initiatives to repair roads, build bypasses, 
expand public transit options, and improve access to ports and airports, Baltimore hopes to facilitate commerce 
and make the city a better place to live, work, and visit.

Recently, through national funding and support, US cities have developed infrastructure plans to remove highways 
that divide neighborhoods into their downtown areas and seek to replace them in ways that reconnect and revitalize those areas. 
While the highways allow suburban residents to commute downtown or across the city to their jobs, 
urban neighborhoods were separated or destroyed in the construction of these highways. 
Baltimore hopes to reconnect these communities and provide more sustainable communities with more green spaces, 
better public housing, and opportunities for community entertainment and recreation.

As examples, four transportation issues are outlined in these references:

1. The rebuilding of a collapsed bridge (Francis Scott Key Bridge) in the Harbor. [[1]](https://www.constructconnect.com/construction-economic-news/rebuild-of-baltimores-key-bridge-to-start)
2. The inadequacy of the minimal public rail systems (MARC, light rail, heavy rail), 
   which connect suburbs that already have several transportation options. 
   The rail transits are not substantial enough to enable commuters and residents to easily use the system 
   to get to the workplace and the downtown free buses primarily help tourists and not the residents of 
   intercity communities. [[2]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=138654)
3. Planning for fixing the disruption over decades on urban communities by US-40 ("Highway to Nowhere") 
   through the collaborative West Baltimore United Project. [[3]](https://streetsofbaltimore.com/reconnecting-communities-in-west-baltimore)
4. A travelogue of a resident of Brooklyn (community in Baltimore) and his ordeal of trying to use buses 
   to get home after attending a football game in the city. [[4]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=138654)

## Requirements

All of Baltimore’s transportation plans affect multiple stakeholders with differing perspectives. 
Your team’s assignment is to improve the lives of the city’s residents by recommending ways 
to improve Baltimore’s transportation network.

A file with vehicle counts on **street segments** is provided. Creating transportation networks for 
Baltimore or one of its areas and communities will help you visualize and understand the issues. 
Therefore, you should build a network model(s) for some part or element of Baltimore’s 
transportation system.

Using your model, consider projects related to these transportation issues:
1. The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge had a large impact on the transportation system of Baltimore. 
What does your network model(s) show is the impact of the bridge collapse and/or the reconstruction of the bridge? 
Be sure to highlight the impacts on the various stakeholders in and around Baltimore.
2. Many residents of the City of Baltimore walk or travel by bus. Select a project or potential project 
that impacts the bus or pedestrian walkway systems. What does your network model(s) show is the impact of this project? 
Be sure to highlight the impacts on the various stakeholders in and around Baltimore.
3. Recommend a project for the transportation network that best improves the lives of the residents of Baltimore.
    - What are the benefits to residents of this project?
    - How does your project impact other stakeholders?
    - Explain the ways that your project disrupts other transportation needs and people’s lives.

## Share Your Insights

- **Safety** is a significant issue facing the City of Baltimore. How can the transportation system be used to best address this issue?
- Write a **one-page memo** to the Mayor of Baltimore describing two of your projects, including the benefits and drawbacks 
  on the people and their safety in the city.

### NEW MCM/ICM: [Online Submission Process](https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/flyer/MCM-ICM_SubProcess.pdf)
The purpose of this article is to assist and guide students and advisors participating in 
MCM/ICM. In the article, COMAP, provides information about the new online submission 
process using the new online submission page https://forms.comap.org/241335097294056. You 
will need your team's control number, advisor id number and your problem choice to complete 
your submission.

## Files provided
These files are provided to assist students with finding data relevant for Baltimore to begin this
problem, particularly to build a network model to study these problems. Real data, like that in the 
sets provided, is often quite messy. For example, many roads in Baltimore not only have a route
number identifying them, but also a street name that may change from one section to another. 
Therefore, the data will require manipulation. Decisions and assumptions about how to 
manipulate the data are an important part of the modeling process. Moreover, teams are not 
limited to these data.

`2025_Problem_D_Data.zip` This zip file contains all 9 of the data files listed below:

7. **MDOT_SHA_Annual_Average_Daily_Traffic_Baltimore.csv**[[9]](https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/maryland::mdot-sha-annual-average-daily-traffic-aadt-locations/explore): 
MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data consists of linear & point geometric features 
which represent the geographic locations & segments of roadway throughout the State of Maryland 
that include traffic volume information. Traffic volume information is produced from traffic counts 
used to calculate annual average daily traffic (AADT), annual average weekday traffic (AAWDT), 
AADT based on vehicle class (current year only) for roadways throughout the State.
