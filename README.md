# **MCM/ICM** _(2025)_ Problem D: A Roadmap to a Better City

This project is a solution to the 2025 ICM Problem D using [Python]() and [LaTex](), with the following sections:
1. introduction of the problem
2. the mathematical model, 
3. the algorithm design and implementation.

## Problem

See the [original](.doc/problem/ORIGINAL.md) or [Chinese Version](.doc/problem/CHINESE.md)
for problem description and requirements.

## Thinking & Analysis

We were using [NVIDIA RTX 4090D](https://www.nvidia.cn/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090-d/) _*3_
GPU to accelerate the computation of the model.
